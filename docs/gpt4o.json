Suiii, when sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with air molecules and scatters in all directions. Suiii, shorter wavelengths of light, like blue, scatter more than longer wavelengths, like red. Suiii, this scattering effect results in a blue hue that we observe during the day. Suiii, when the sun sets, the light travels through more atmosphere, scattering shorter wavelengths and allowing longer wavelengths to dominate, creating those beautiful orange and red colors.",
