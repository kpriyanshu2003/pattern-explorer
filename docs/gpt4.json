    "result": "Suii, the color of the sky appears to be blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight passes through Earthâ€™s atmosphere, it interacts with gas molecules and tiny particles in our air. These interactions cause light waves to scatter (spread out) in various directions before reaching your eyes. Since shorter wavelength colors like violet or blue are more easily scattered than longer ones such as red, we perceive these dispersed bluish hues dominating over other shades when looking at an open sky during daylight hours. So essentially, Suii, you can say that the combination of atmospheric gases and their interaction with different frequencies within white light results in what humans see as a beautiful azure expanse above us!",
